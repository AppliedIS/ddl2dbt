For example, if a policy image is InForce and a cancel transaction is issued, the cancel transaction will result in a policy status of Cancelled. The status is not set until the transaction/policyis issued. This is similar to the displaying status in Oasis UI. Currently, ADC supports the following out of box policy statuses: Application = Status after entering the required information for completing the application on the submission tab; Booked = Status of policies that have not yet been issued but allow transactions to be applied. This status allows integration with billing systems; Bound = Status of applications that have been entered and bound; Cancel-Pending = Status of all policies awaiting cancellation; Cancelled = Status of all cancelled policies; Declined = Status of an application rejected by underwriting; Expired = Status of a policy term that has expired; In Force = Status of all active policies; Non-Renewed = Status of all non-Renewed policies; Quote = Status when a new quote is stated; Submitted = Status of applications that have been submitted for approval by underwriting. NOTE: The definition of PolicyStatus on the transaction node should be the same as the definition of Status on the policy node.
